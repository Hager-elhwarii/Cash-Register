# Cash-Register ðŸ’¡
- Continuing my javascript algorithms and data structures Projects with Cash Register.
  
- Cash Register is a function that accepts three arguments:-
  
  ðŸ”¹(price) => purchase price as the first argument.

  ðŸ”¹(cash) => payment as the second argument.

  ðŸ”¹(cid) => is a 2D array listing available currency.

 - The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.
 
 - if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.
   
   âœ… Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []}

 - if with cash-in-drawer  is equal to the change due.

   âœ… Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]}

 - Otherwise

   âœ… return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}
   
 Note => with the change, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.
